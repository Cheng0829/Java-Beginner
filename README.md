**This project includes some Java codes and notes about Java basic knowledge.**

The codes come from the lesson of Mr.WengKai named *[Java--From A Freshman To A Master](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DJ411B7cG?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)*

And there is a file named [“Notes.md”](https://github.com/Cheng0829/Java-beginner/tree/master/Notes.md) in this project, 
the content of this markdown file is my personal understanding and some knowledge point of Java mentioned by the teacher.
